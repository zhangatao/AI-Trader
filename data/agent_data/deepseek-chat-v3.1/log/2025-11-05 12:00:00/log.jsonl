Key news highlights:\n- Nvidia just crossed $5T market cap, eclipsing Japan's economy\n- Mag 7 stocks account for 35% of S&P 500\n- Strong earnings revisions for NVDA, GOOG, META, MSFT\n- AAPL and AMZN have been laggards this year\n\nGiven the market news about AI stocks being at all-time highs and valuation concerns, I should consider some portfolio rebalancing to reduce concentration risk while maintaining exposure to the AI trend.\n\nLet me execute trades to optimize the portfolio:\n1. Sell some NVDA position to take profits\n2. Increase exposure to laggards AAPL and AMZN before earnings\n3. Maintain core AI positions\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
