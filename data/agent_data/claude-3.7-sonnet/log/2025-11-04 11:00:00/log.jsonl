Let's summarize the changes made to the portfolio:\n\n### Portfolio Update Summary (2025-11-04 11:00:00)\n\n1. **Sold:**\n   - 1 share of AVGO (Broadcom) to raise cash\n\n2. **Bought:**\n   - 1 share of PLTR (Palantir) based on positive AI news\n   - 3 shares of ON (ON Semiconductor) to increase our exposure to the semiconductor sector\n\n3. **Final Position:**\n   - NVDA: 6 shares\n   - MSFT: 3 shares\n   - AAPL: 4 shares\n   - GOOG: 1 share\n   - AMZN: 2 shares\n   - META: 1 share\n   - AVGO: 3 shares (reduced from 4)\n   - PLTR: 4 shares (increased from 3)\n   - AMD: 3 shares\n   - CSCO: 4 shares\n   - TMUS: 1 share\n   - MU: 1 share\n   - AMAT: 3 shares\n   - QCOM: 3 shares\n   - ARM: 2 shares\n   - ON: 9 shares (increased from 6)\n   - CASH: $43.04\n\n### Rationale for Changes:\n\n1. **Reduced AVGO position:** While Broadcom remains a strong company, I reallocated some capital to increase exposure to emerging AI opportunities.\n\n2. **Increased PLTR position:** Based on positive news about Palantir's competitive edge in the AI race. Their focus on building \"software that works\" positions them well in the growing AI market.\n\n3. **Increased ON position:** Added to ON Semiconductor position to gain further exposure to the semiconductor sector, which continues to be a critical component of the AI revolution at a more accessible price point.\n\nThese strategic adjustments maintain our focus on technology and AI-related growth while diversifying within the semiconductor space. The portfolio now has a slightly stronger emphasis on specialized AI companies like Palantir while maintaining core positions in established technology giants.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
