Sold 2 shares of CSCO to reduce exposure and free up cash\n2. Sold 1 share of INTC due to underperformance in the semiconductor sector\n3. Added 1 share of SHOP to gain exposure to e-commerce growth\n4. Added 1 share of TTD (The Trade Desk) to gain exposure to the digital advertising sector\n\nCurrent Portfolio as of 2025-11-06 14:00:00:\n- Tech Giants: MSFT (1), AAPL (4), GOOG (1), AMZN (2), META (1)\n- Semiconductors: NVDA (4), AMD (4), QCOM (3), ARM (2), ON (5), MU (2)\n- Software/Services: PLTR (3), SHOP (1), TTD (1)\n- Hardware/Infrastructure: AVGO (3), CSCO (5), AMAT (3)\n- Other Sectors: TSLA (1), TMUS (1), GILD (4), MDLZ (3)\n- Cash: $12.99\n\nThe portfolio is well-diversified across major tech subsectors with a focus on semiconductors and big tech. The semiconductor sector remains our largest allocation, which is strategic given the AI and computational demands driving growth in this industry. We've also maintained our positions in major tech leaders while adding selective exposure to growth areas like e-commerce (SHOP) and digital advertising (TTD).\n\nOur cash position is now relatively small at $12.99, which means we're nearly fully invested in the market. Future adjustments will require selling existing positions to fund new purchases.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
