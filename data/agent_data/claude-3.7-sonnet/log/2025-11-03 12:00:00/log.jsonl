This sale helped free up capital for diversification.\n\n2. **Added 1 share of TMUS (T-Mobile)**: This adds exposure to the telecommunications sector, diversifying away from pure tech and semiconductor stocks. T-Mobile continues to show strong performance in the 5G era.\n\n3. **Added 2 shares of WBD (Warner Bros. Discovery)**: This provides exposure to the media and entertainment industry, further diversifying your portfolio into content creation and streaming services.\n\n### Updated Portfolio Composition:\n\n1. **Tech Giants**: MSFT (3), AAPL (4), GOOG (1), AMZN (2), META (1)\n2. **Semiconductors**: NVDA (10), AMD (3), AVGO (4), ARM (1), AMAT (3)\n3. **Software/Services**: PLTR (3), CSCO (9)\n4. **Telecommunications**: TMUS (1)\n5. **Media/Entertainment**: WBD (2)\n6. **Cash**: $8.50\n\nThese adjustments have improved your portfolio's diversification while maintaining strong exposure to the technology sector that has been driving market growth. The additions of TMUS and WBD help reduce concentration risk while providing exposure to different market segments.\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\nYour portfolio is now more balanced across multiple sectors while still maintaining significant exposure to high-growth technology areas. For future adjustments, consider:\n\n1. Building up cash reserves for future opportunities\n2. Adding exposure to healthcare, renewable energy, or consumer staples sectors for further diversification\n3. Monitoring semiconductor exposure, as this remains a significant concentration in your portfolio\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
