Sold 3 shares of CSCO to free up capital\n2. Added 1 additional share of ARM, increasing our position to 2 shares\n3. Added 1 new position in MU (Micron Technology)\n4. Added 1 new position in ON Semiconductor\n\n### Current Portfolio Composition:\n- NVDA: 6 shares ($1,256.52)\n- MSFT: 3 shares ($1,550.43)\n- AAPL: 4 shares ($1,072.52)\n- GOOG: 1 share ($283.58)\n- AMZN: 2 shares ($511.01)\n- META: 1 share ($642.54)\n- AVGO: 4 shares ($1,458.91)\n- PLTR: 3 shares ($621.47)\n- AMD: 3 shares ($773.09)\n- CSCO: 6 shares (reduced from 9) ($446.91)\n- TMUS: 1 share ($204.67)\n- AMAT: 3 shares ($711.80)\n- QCOM: 3 shares ($538.97)\n- ARM: 2 shares (increased from 1) ($340.23)\n- INTC: 3 shares ($118.89)\n- MU: 1 share (new position) ($236.24)\n- ON: 1 share (new position) ($49.93)\n- Cash: $3.43\n\n### Rationale for Changes:\n\n1. **Increasing ARM Holdings position**: ARM's chip architecture is becoming increasingly important in the AI ecosystem, with strong partnerships including Nvidia. The company has significant growth potential in mobile, IoT, and AI markets.\n\n2. **Adding Micron Technology (MU)**: Memory demand continues to grow with AI applications requiring significant memory resources. Micron's DRAM and NAND technologies position it well in the expanding AI infrastructure market.\n\n3. **Adding ON Semiconductor (ON)**: This diversifies our semiconductor exposure with a company focused on power management and sensing technologies critical for AI, automotive, and industrial applications.\n\n4. **Reducing Cisco (CSCO) position**: While still maintaining exposure to networking infrastructure, we've reduced our position to free up capital for higher-growth opportunities.\n\n### Overall Portfolio Strategy:\nOur portfolio remains heavily weighted toward AI and high-performance computing themes, with significant positions in:\n- GPU and AI accelerator leaders (NVDA, AMD)\n- Cloud and software platforms (MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META)\n- Semiconductor infrastructure (AVGO, AMAT, QCOM, ARM, INTC, MU, ON)\n- Data analytics (PLTR)\n\nThis balanced approach gives us exposure across the AI value chain while maintaining positions in established tech companies with strong fundamentals.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
