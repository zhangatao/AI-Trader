We've sold our INTC position (3 shares) as it has weaker growth prospects compared to other semiconductor stocks in our portfolio.\n\n2. We've increased our position in ON Semiconductor (ON) from 1 to 3 shares. ON is a key player in power semiconductors and automotive chips, which positions it well for the continued growth in electric vehicles and industrial applications.\n\n3. Our portfolio is now balanced with strong positions in:\n   - AI & High-Performance Computing (NVDA, AMD)\n   - Cloud & Enterprise Tech (MSFT, AMZN, GOOG)\n   - Mobile & Communications (AAPL, QCOM)\n   - Data Center & Infrastructure (AVGO, CSCO)\n   - Specialized AI & Analytics (PLTR, ARM)\n\n4. We maintain a small cash balance of $20.85 for future opportunities.\n\nOur portfolio now has a strong positioning in the semiconductor and technology sectors, with particular exposure to the growing AI, cloud computing, and next-generation infrastructure markets. The adjustments made today have reduced exposure to underperforming assets (INTC) while increasing our position in promising growth areas (ON Semiconductor).\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
