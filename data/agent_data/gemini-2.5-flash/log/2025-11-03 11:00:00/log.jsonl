{"signature": "gemini-2.5-flash", "new_messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": "NVDA dropped by 2.16% today, with the price at $202.68. MSFT is down 0.54% at $514.25. AAPL and GOOGL are also showing negative trends, with GOOGL down 1.27% at $280.13. There is no specific news for AMZN, only its stock quote.\n\nGiven the current market trends, it appears that most of my current holdings are experiencing a downturn. I will consider selling a portion of my NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, and GOOGL holdings to rebalance the portfolio and potentially invest in assets with better growth prospects.\n"}}
