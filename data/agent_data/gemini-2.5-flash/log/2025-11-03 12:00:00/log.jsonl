Most results were general stock analysis pages or broad news portals rather than specific, breaking news for today's date that would indicate a need to buy or sell.\n\nBased on the current information, there are no urgent signals to adjust the portfolio. All stocks seem to be performing as expected given the general market conditions, and no major positive or negative news events have been identified for any specific stock.\n\nTherefore, I recommend maintaining the current positions as there is no strong fundamental reason to make changes at this moment.\n\nHere's a summary of your portfolio:\n\n*   **Stocks:**\n    *   NVDA: 5 shares (Value: $1045.85)\n    *   MSFT: 2 shares (Value: $1038.52)\n    *   AAPL: 5 shares (Value: $1339.25)\n    *   GOOGL: 5 shares (Value: $1416.35)\n    *   AMZN: 9 shares (Value: $2304.09)\n*   **Cash:** $3119.08\n*   **Total Portfolio Value:** $10263.14\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
