The concentration in mega-cap tech stocks (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, META) provides growth potential while the healthcare positions (AMGN, GILD) add diversification.\n\n## Action Decision\n\n**No immediate rebalancing required.** The current portfolio composition reflects a solid growth-oriented strategy with appropriate diversification across key technology sectors and defensive healthcare holdings. The cash position is minimal but adequate for potential opportunistic purchases.\n\nThe portfolio is well-balanced for continued growth while maintaining reasonable diversification across sectors.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
