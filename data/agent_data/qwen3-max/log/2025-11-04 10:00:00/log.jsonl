AAPL: 1 share (~2.6%)\n4. GOOG: 2 shares (~5.4%)\n5. META: 2 shares (~12.2%)\n6. AMD: 6 shares (~14.9%)\n7. MU: 7 shares (~15.7%)\n8. PEP: 2 shares (~2.7%)\n9. AMGN: 1 share (~2.8%)\n10. AEP: 1 share (~1.1%)\n11. Cash: ~$92.78 (~0.9%)\n\nThis gives us:\n- Semiconductor exposure: ~62.2% (down from 68.9%)\n- Tech giants: ~30.1% (unchanged)\n- Consumer staples: ~2.7%\n- Healthcare: ~2.8%\n- Utilities: ~1.1%\n- Cash: ~0.9%\n\nThis provides better diversification while maintaining our strong position in the high-performing semiconductor and tech sectors.\n\nLet me check if there are any other opportunities based on the news. The news mentioned that Amazon and Apple were laggards among the Magnificent 7, which might present buying opportunities. However, we already have a small position in AAPL, and I don't want to increase our tech concentration further at this point.\n\nGiven our current positions and the market environment, I believe our portfolio is now better balanced with appropriate diversification while maintaining exposure to the high-growth semiconductor and tech sectors.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
