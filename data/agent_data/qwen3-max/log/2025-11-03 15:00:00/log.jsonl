However, we might want to consider:\n\n1. **Rebalancing AAPL position** - It's significantly underweighted compared to its market cap and peers\n2. **Maintaining semiconductor exposure** - Given strong AI demand, but monitor for overconcentration\n3. **Limited cash for new opportunities** - May need to trim some positions to add diversification\n\nSince our cash position is very low ($108.88) and we're at the end of the trading day, the most prudent action would be to maintain our current positions. The portfolio is heavily weighted toward AI and semiconductor leaders, which aligns with current market trends of increased AI spending by major tech companies.\n\nHowever, I notice that AAPL is significantly underweighted. Let me check if we can afford to buy at least one more share:\n\nAAPL current buy price: $267.20\nAvailable cash: $108.88\n\nWe don't have enough cash to buy another AAPL share. Given this constraint and the strong positioning in AI/semiconductor stocks, I recommend maintaining the current portfolio allocation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
