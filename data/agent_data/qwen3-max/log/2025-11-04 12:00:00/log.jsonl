This further diversifies my portfolio into the utilities sector.\n\nLet me now assess the updated portfolio allocation:\n\nUpdated positions:\n- NVDA: 12 shares @ $201.50 = $2,418.00 (24.2% of equity)\n- AMD: 6 shares @ $254.96 = $1,529.76 (15.3% of equity)\n- MU: 7 shares @ $224.64 = $1,572.45 (15.7% of equity)\n- MSFT: 2 shares @ $513.42 = $1,026.84 (10.3% of equity)\n- META: 2 shares @ $631.75 = $1,263.50 (12.6% of equity)\n- GOOG: 2 shares @ $279.20 = $558.40 (5.6% of equity)\n- AAPL: 1 share @ $270.56 = $270.56 (2.7% of equity)\n- PEP: 4 shares @ $143.11 = $572.42 (5.7% of equity)\n- AMGN: 1 share @ $297.97 = $297.97 (3.0% of equity)\n- AEP: 3 shares @ $120.34 = $361.02 (3.6% of equity)\n- Cash: $371.83 (3.6% of total portfolio)\n\nThe semiconductor concentration has been reduced from 61.9% to 55.2% of equity, and I've increased my defensive allocations in consumer staples and utilities. My cash position is now more reasonable at 3.6% of the total portfolio, providing some dry powder for future opportunities.\n\nThis rebalancing has achieved the following:\n1. Reduced concentration risk in semiconductors\n2. Increased defensive positioning with consumer staples and utilities\n3. Maintained core tech exposure to high-quality companies\n4. Improved cash position for flexibility\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
